	<p>My name is Dominic Bradfute, I was born on April 24th, 1998 in San Jose, California. I moved to Texas about 2 years later, and I've lived here ever since. I enjoy video games, rock music, comedies, and all around good movies, music, and tv shows. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Some of my favorite video games are Skyrim, Bioshock, Destiny, Overwatch, Bloodborne, and Pokemon. My favorite genre of music is rock/hard rock, I listen to Disturbed, Seether, Shinedown, Hollywood Undead, Three Days Grace, Bullet For My Valentine, Five Finger Death Punch, Avenged Sevenfold, etc. I like shows ranging from comedies like South Park, Rick and Morty, and Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, to more serious stuff like Breaking Bad.
